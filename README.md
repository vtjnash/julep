Welcome to the Julep wiki for Julia Enhancement Proposals!

Head right on over to read, write, edit, and comment on Julep proposals:
https://github.com/vtjnash/julep/wiki

If you want to start a discussion on a proposal, please start a comment thread at the bottom of the wiki page for that Julep. Please sign and date your comments. An example is given below (with appropriate Markdown formatting):

```

Over time, the original author (or other contributor, as appropriate) will update the top post and summarize or remove out-of-date discussions. That will ensure that future participants can get caught up quickly on the key issues. The full history will always be available on the page archive anyhow.

Or if you want to make a comment on the process overall, open an issue on this repo to start a discussion.

Please remember that the contributor and community guidelines from the main repo also apply here. https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
